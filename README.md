## Two-Tier Convention System

The plugin supports a **two-tier convention system**:

```
.claude/
├── rules/              # Techstack rules (can be a git submodule)
│   ├── backend/        # Generic Laravel/PHP patterns
│   └── frontend/       # Generic Vue/TypeScript patterns
└── project-rules/      # Project-specific rules (optional)
    ├── backend/        # This project's backend patterns
    └── frontend/       # This project's frontend patterns
```

- **Techstack rules** (`.claude/rules/`) - Generic patterns that can be shared across projects
- **Project rules** (`.claude/project-rules/`) - Patterns specific to this codebase (e.g., example tests, boilerplate)

Roles and skills automatically check for both, loading techstack rules first, then project-specific rules if they exist.

```

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Activate tech lead role
/roles/techlead

# 2. Start planning a feature
/linear/start-project

# 3. Switch to implementation role
/roles/backend-engineer

# 4. Work on an issue
/linear/work-on-issue PRO-123

# 5. Review project progress
/roles/techlead
/linear/review-project my-project
```

## Team Setup (Auto-Install)

Add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "marketplaces": [
      {
        "source": "https://github.com/RasmusGodske/dev-agent-workflow"
      }
    ],
    "installed": [
      {
        "name": "project-roles",
        "marketplace": "RasmusGodske"
      },
      {
        "name": "rules-boilerplate",
        "marketplace": "RasmusGodske"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When team members trust the repository folder, plugins install automatically.
