I like to experiment with an idea that could improve the documentation of a codebase as well as provide creating some better context for Claude Code instances in the beginning of sessions. 

Right now the when starting a new Claude Code session, the developers often starts with either asking for help troubleshooting a specific error or implementing a new feature. The current way of providing context has been to either manually explain how the codebase or the relevant domain/feature works while maybe provide a few references to specific files. The developer could also tell ClaudeCode to activate use some of the domain/feature specific ClaudeCode skills, that has been written to provide more context about the codebase. This sort of works, but it does get repetitive and tedious for the developer to always have to explain the same things over and over again. For the skills, we also see that they don't really get updated and they often become outdated as the codebase evolves. They are really only as good as the last time they were updated. So while they do help reduce the manual research phase that ClaudeCode has to do, they still aren't perfect. 

So the idea is to try to create a system, that the primary ClaudeCode instance can prompt or ask to do the initial research and context gathering about the codebase. This "system" may it be as simple as a ClaudeCode subagent, will then take a prompt / request from the primary ClaudeCode instance, and then go and explore the codebase to gather relevant context information. This research agent will first look for any existing documentation files in the codebase, stored in markdown files. If it does not find any relevant documentation files, it will document the lack of documentation as well, in a specific folder within the codebase repository eg. "docs/lacking/{feature}/missing-report.md". This inital missing documentation report would describe what were asked for but could not be found in the existing documentation files. Furthermore the research agent will also look for any existing code comments in the codebase files, and gather relevant code comments that could help explain how the code works. The research agent will then generate a summary report of the existing documentation and code comments, and store it in a specific folder within the codebase repository eg. "docs/existing/{feature}/summary-report.md". This summary report would describe what documentation and code comments were found, and provide links to the relevant files. The research agent will then return the summary report to the primary ClaudeCode instance, which will then continue it's orignal task, now with the added context from the research agent.

What this system would provide us is a way to provide that documents the lack of documentation as well as give us a better way to do the initial research phase of understanding a codebase. This missing documentation report can then be processed by another ClaudeCode instance, that runs on a scheduled basis or on commit, that can go through the missing documentation reports, and then generate the new documentation files that are missing. Having a separate scheduled ClaudeCode instance do this allows us to not block the primary ClaudeCode instance that is working on the developers original task, while still ensuring that the codebase documentation is continuously improved over time.

The scheduled ClaudeCode instance could also have a lot more context and knowledge about how documentation should be written and the filestructure about where it should be stored, as it is only focused on documentation generation. This would allow us to have a more specialized ClaudeCode instance that can focus on generating high quality documentation, while the primary ClaudeCode instance can focus on helping the developer with their specific tasks.

Having the Documentation agent and the Research agent separated also allows us to have a more modular system, where we can easily swap out or update the research agent or the documentation agent without affecting the other. This would allow us to continuously improve and evolve the system over time, as we learn more about how to best document codebases and provide context for ClaudeCode instances.


Also for the documentation claude code agent, I am thinking for a start, that we would simply create a agent that sort of works like the other agents we have defined within project-roles/commands/roles. What it will do, is to tell ClaudeCode to look at .claude/rules/documentation/README.md for the conventions and guidelines on how to write good documentation for the codebase. This then means that we can define how that is done on a repository level instead of doing it within our plugin. 

For the research agent, we should create a dedicated agent within: `project-roles/agents/research-agent.md`. This agent will then be responsible for doing the research and context gathering about the codebase. It should also look in `.claude/rules/documentation/README.md` to figure out the documentation structur
